arch-luks-suspend
==================

A script for [Arch Linux][] to lock the encrypted root volume on suspend.

When using [dm-crypt with LUKS][] to set up full system encryption, the
encryption key is kept in memory when suspending the system. This drawback
defeats the purpose of encryption if you carry around your suspended laptop
a lot. One can use the `cryptsetup luksSuspend` command to freeze all I/O and
flush the key from memory, but special care must be taken when applying it to
the root device.

The `arch-linux-suspend` script replaces the default suspend mechanism of
systemd. It changes root to initramfs in order to perform the `luksSuspend`,
actual suspend, and `luksResume` operations. It relies on the `shutdown`
initcpio hook to provide access to the initramfs.

It needs a LVM-on-dm-crypt setup to work properly. Also, only the very basic
variant has been tested.
